## Hardware description
In our project we used arduino uno board with external modules. In our case we were using joy-stick, rotary encoder and PmodCLP LCD module.

As we can see, we are reading two analog values from the joy-stick, two digital values form an encoder and for each component we also get switch signal. 

* Rotary Encoder
